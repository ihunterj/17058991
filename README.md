<b>Difficulty Level</b> <br />
In this application there is a simple difficulty level, after the first run if the user scores 8/10 or more they will be set to difficulty level 1 which may consist of harder questions than the first time around. The default difficulty setting is 0, and if the user scores less than 8 on the harder difficulty it will return to the original difficulty level (0).
